## About me
I joined the [UTHealth School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI)](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/miran-kim.htm) at University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston on May 1, 2018 as an assistant professor. Before arriving at SBMI, Kim was a post-doctoral researcher at the Division of Biomedical Informatics of UC San Diego. I obtained my Ph.D. degrees in mathematical sciences from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2017. My advisor was [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/).

## Research Interest
My research focuses on the design of novel strategies to enable secure and privacy-preserving data analysis. I have an extensive experience in implementation of efficient protocols for data query processing, genomic computation, and cyber-physical systems. In 2015, 2017, and 2018, I received HLI awards for genome data privacy challenges of iDASH Genome Privacy & Security competition supported by National Institutes of Health.
